Mean And Median Filter for image Processing
Average (or mean) filtering is a method of 'smoothing' images by reducing the amount of intensity variation between neighbouring pixels. The average filter works by moving through the image pixel by pixel, replacing each value with the average value of neighbouring pixels, including itself.
